### What i've learned:
# I learned the difference between cloning and forking, the use of the "Issues" tab, and the use of pull requests.

# I feel like everthing has been pretty clarified to me, I don't have any speicifc questions.

### Hobbies

# I enjoy running track and cross country, as well as playing casual sports like spikeball and pickleball. I'm pretty competitive when it comes to things I take seriously. I have many creative outlets I enjoy, like Pixel art, Music Production, and also game design. I like watching youtube, movies, eating good food. I like to learn programming, but I sort of write spaghetti code. (I'm working on it.) I also play piano, and am trying to learn guitar.
